## What is Koa.js?
Koa is also an open-source Node.js web framework designed by the team behind ExpressJS. Their main aims are a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs. Koa is an expressive HTTP middleware framework for node.js.

### Koa has so many functions called,

app.callback()
app.context()
app.keys =
app.listen()
app.use()
Request & Respons (These two also have so many functions)
These features are used to tackle API’s asynchronous calls. That means the Koa help eliminate the need for callbacks and significantly improves error handling.

## Features of Koa.js
Koa.js has its own features that make it a more expressive, developer-friendly, and more robust foundation. Following are the features of it,

ES6 generators: This uses for asynchronous programming and controls the code execution.
Modern and future-proof: Koa.js build is based on ES6. So, it makes complex applications simpler by providing new classes and modules. Using this developers can build more maintainable applications.
Has a small footprint: Compare to other Node.js frameworks, Koas has a smaller footprint. This helps to write thinner middlewares. It makes web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write.
Designed as a lightweight and flexible framework for Node.js: This provides a minimal interface for developing web applications and APIs.
Identifies and understands all HTTP methods: There are so many HTTP methods. Koa can identify those methods and it will helpful for developers to build their applications more reliably.
Has a built-in catchall: This will help for error handling.
Uses a context object: It is an encapsulation of request and response objects.

### How to Install Koa.js?

First of all, we have to Init an npm project. We can use “Webstrome” as our IDE. Create a directory for all the project-related files.

`` $ npm init ``

This will generate a package.json file that holds all dependencies we added to our project.
